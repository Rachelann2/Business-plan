                                My name is Rachel Silverthorn. I want to create a business called Hustle House that not
                                only will create a new community, but also a program to better the lives of everyone who
                                is involved.

                                According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity and overweight together are the
                                second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, close behind tobacco
                                use. An estimated 300,000 deaths per year are due to the obesity epidemic, Hustle House
                                will create a program to help ordinary people learn how to eat and exercise to maintain
                                a healthy weight and I want to create the technology in order to program such a
                                widespread solution.
                                <br>
                                From a young age I have always struggled with body image issues, being a young girl in
                                today's society there are so many expectations on looks with unrealistic images of
                                famous models. I grew up with parents that always chose to build me up, my step mom
                                would take me to many different fitness studios, trying crossfit, pilates, yoga, spin;
                                you name it, I have tried it, working on ways to feel the most confident in my image. My
                                dad has always made me feel confident not only in my own skin but also throughout
                                school, when I struggled academically he was always the first person to sit down and
                                help me understand.
                                <br>
                                I soon went off to University of California, Davis, following in my older brothers
                                footsteps (he also went to davis) I soon began to struggle with how hard the classes
                                were. With UC Davis being one of the top 5 universities in the country, the stakes of
                                success came with great pressure. What most people do not see is how hard it is to work
                                through these classes at the pace of a quarter system but the information of a semester.
                                Not surprisingly, depression was increased throughout students in the college campus,
                                “At UC Davis, 29 enrolled students have committed suicide over the past 20 years, with
                                never more than three students killing themselves in a single year, Rodolfa said.
                                Additionally, the center has hospitalized about 12 to 15 suicidal students a year.”- Amy
                                Agronis.Providing that depression is a serious issue that is partnered with the demands
                                of a top university.
                                <br>
                                I noticed that I began to struggle with anxiety, and spin was my release of the demands.
                                My brother has also fought with anxiety and depression. We didn’t have parents that
                                expected us to get straight A’s and reprimand us if I wasn’t on the Dean's list, but we
                                could only imagine what the students felt like whose parents were more demanding of
                                them. All of these issues are brought onto students at such a young age, many do not
                                know how to deal with the struggle of not being good enough.
                                <br>
                                That is where our family comes in; I found my niche studying exercise biology at UC
                                Davis, learning the health benefits behind exercise and eating healthy; and how they
                                change the neurological releases within the body. In shorthand, exercise is the leading
                                “medicine” or antidote for depression, diabetes, some cancers and the ability to live
                                longer. Exercise is something so simple as walking your dog around the block, or healthy
                                eating as cutting out foods that most people don’t even realize is bad for them. Did you
                                know that a mango has more sugar in it than a Coca Cola? While most people will reach
                                for the mango instead of coke, what do people really know about food and exercise other
                                than whats the new fad diet or class to take.
                                <br>
                                Hustle House is a program that I want to build based on getting to know each and every
                                customer on a deeper basis than any other workout program. The app/website program will
                                start by asking about weight loss, gain or maintain. Then figure out if the client
                                struggles with any type of mental illness, whether it be depression or anxiety or
                                something more; I want each client to feel like they are getting a personalized coach to
                                better not only their outside image but also there inside self-esteem.

                                As a young UC Davis college grad, I not only have the time and dedication, I have the
                                heart and experience behind it all. From being a young girl struggling with my inner
                                self-esteem to grow into this role of helping others create a better self-image there is
                                nothing I am more passionate about. Leading this community with a heavy heart to create
                                a stronger commitment to living without the social demands of perfection. Now is a time
                                to be vulnerable and work to create a better life for not only oneself but for everyone
                                else around them, inspiring each next generation to work on themselves inside out rather
                                than outside in.
                                <br>
                                I have seen first hand what body-image, depression, anxiety and hurt self-esteem does to
                                a person and I believe I have the power to help create a better system through my
                                program of exercise and healthy lifestyles to build our community up. While my family
                                has helped me through each determining step in life, I want the same gift brought to our
                                community. My dad is willing to put his faith into my brother and I to create this
                                program in the Sacramento community. My step mom has dedicated her time and hard work to
                                help us accomplish this goal. As a family we want to accomplish this goal to building a
                                community of people who want to better themselves, when they might not even know they
                                need it.
                                <br>
                                Everyone has a struggle whether it be there own or someone close to them, I want to give
                                this community a chance to change, to work to create a better self-image. It starts now,
                                with Hustle House.
